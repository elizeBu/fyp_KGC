Here are all code for path ranking algorithm. 
For Nell995 dataset, we do single-task learning and multi-task learning.
The dataset for single-task learning can be downloaded from https://github.com/xwhan/DeepPath
The dataset for multi-task learning can be downloaded from https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE/tree/OpenKE-PyTorch/benchmarks.
Fb15k-237 and WN18RR dataset can also be downloaded from here. They all do multi-task learning.
