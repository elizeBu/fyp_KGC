# KGC, Relational Path inference, Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA)

Thanks [Davide-Lee](https://github.com/David-Lee-1990/Path-ranking-algorithm) provided the Python version of PRA code.
Here are all code for path ranking algorithm. 

## Dataset
For Nell995 dataset, we do single-task learning and multi-task learning.

(1) For single-task learning can be downloaded from [DeepPath](https://github.com/xwhan/DeepPath).

(2) For multi-task learning can be downloaded from [openKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE/tree/OpenKE-PyTorch/benchmarks).
(Fb15k-237 and WN18RR dataset can also be downloaded from here. They all do multi-task learning.)

## Experimental environment
* Python version: 3.6+
